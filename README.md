# GSAPP RED Review

A catch-all for RED related news and a student-run tumblr (blog) for school and industry updates. The tumblr will feed content into the GSAPP website.

## Format

A tumblr theme that will accomodate all posts types and include:

*   live feed of the next two upcoming RED-tagged events from events.gsapp.org
*   live feed of the latest two RED-tagged posts from ccgsapp.org
*	dedicated space for latest CURE news
*   page with directory of all current students with photos, names and links to LinkedIn profiles, highlighting program council and RED Review editors
*   page incorporating RED travel twitter feeds (~January each year)
*   page listing all previous RED newsletters (links to Mailchimp newsletters) - should there be a signup?
*   list of resources for RED alumni
*   consideration for sticky major announcements (banner? medalion?) such as "CURE Benefit MM/DD"
*
